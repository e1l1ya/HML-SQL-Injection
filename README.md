# 🚩 SQL Injection Challenge

> 🧠 **This challenge is created for [HackMeLocal.com](https://hackmelocal.com)** — a platform focused on hands-on cybersecurity learning and local CTF challenges.

Welcome! This is a beginner-friendly SQL Injection challenge designed for learning and practicing web security concepts in a safe environment.

You can run this challenge in **two easy ways**:

- ✅ **Option 1:** Run it locally using Docker  
- ✅ **Option 2:** Run it online using GitHub Codespaces (no installation needed)

## 🖥️ Option 1: Run Locally (Using Docker)

### ✅ Requirements

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed

### 🔧 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-injection-challenge.git
   cd sql-injection-challenge
   ```

2. **Start the Challenge**

   Run this command in the project folder:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

3. **Access the App**

   Once the app is running, open your browser and go to:
